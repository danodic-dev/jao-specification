# jao-specification
The specification for the jao file format.

# What is JAO?
JAO stands for Json Animated Objects. It is a specification for defining event-driven, animated UI components using a JSON file. This specification was created initially for use in game development, but can probably be used for other purposes.

# Why?
Defining the visual behaviour of UI components outside of your code can help with a few things:
- Decouple the logical behavior (code & logic) from the visual behavior (graphics & animation) of the UI component;
- Allow for the development and test of the visual behavior of UI components before integrating them into your code, leading to a quick develop-test-fix cycle;
- Preview & tweaking of the UI of a game without having to run the game by using a visual editor/visualizer.

# Use Case: Rushbeat
The main reason why that was developed for Rushbeat was the development of menus and UI components:
- The menu has a lot of animation and eye candy which required tweaking. Being developed by a single person, time is a crucial resource -- the use of JAO and the JAO Visualizer has saved a lot of time with UI development;
- The entire game UI uses a skin system. Using JAO allow for the skin (appearance) to be decoupled from the code (logic). Users of the game can create their own skins without having to write code.

Here is an example of what the UI of Rushbeat looks like:

Menus & Gameplay graphics have extensively used the JAO library. Every graphical component (except by the widgets in the settings screen) have been drawn and animated using JAO files (even music/sound is played back and defined inside the JAO files).

# Specification - File Format
A jao file follows this structure:
```
root
┠─ jao.json
┠─ sample.png
┖─ images
   ┖─ another_sample.png
```

1. The root can be either a filesystem folder or a zip file, with the extension changed to `.jao`.
2. A file named `jao.json` has to be placed at the root folder. This file contains all the description of the events and animations.
3. You can have files (like images) at either the root folder or inside nested folders. All paths inside the `.jao` file are relative to the root folder.

**Notes**:
- For production usage, it is better to use the `.jao` file. The folder is useful for development, when you are tweaking the component.
- The file formats for the resources inside the `.jao` file do not have an specified type. The supported types are dependent on the implementation.
